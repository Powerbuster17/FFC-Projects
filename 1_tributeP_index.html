              On 26 August 2021 a new website was launched, with the title ABBA
              Voyage. On the page, visitors were prompted to subscribe 'to be
              the first in line to hear more about ABBA Voyage'.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simultaneously with the launch of the webpage, new ABBA Voyage
              social media accounts were launched, and billboards around London
              started to appear, all showing the date "02.09.21", leading to
              expectation of what was to be revealed on that date.
            </p>
            <p>
              On 29 August, the band officially joined TikTok with a video of
              Benny Andersson playing "Dancing Queen" on the piano, and media
              reported on a new album to be announced on 2 September.
            </p>
            <p>
              On that date, Voyage, their first new album in 40 years, was
              announced to be released on 5 November 2021, along with ABBA
              Voyage, a concert residency in London featuring the motion capture
              digital avatars of the four band members alongside a 10-piece live
              band, due to start in May 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fältskog stated that the Voyage album and tour are likely to be
              their last.
            </p>
            <p>
              The announcement of the new album was accompanied by the release
              of the previously-announced new singles "I Still Have Faith in
              You" and "Don't Shut Me Down".
